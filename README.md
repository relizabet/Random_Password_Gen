## Notes

- I initially was going to use one letter array and .toUpperCase, however, when I used this it gave me the same letter. Because of this I used two separate arrays
- I had to make the decision between using .split or an already split array and I chose to separate the array myself
- Initially I wanted to use an empty array to .push the arrays selected by checkboxes, but I chose not to do this as I was concerned there would be a chance once randomly selected it would \*\*\*, chose to randomize functions instead
